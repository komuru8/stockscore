# Deployment wrapper file for TOP.py
# This file serves as the entry point for deployment while keeping the main application in TOP.py

# Import and run the main Streamlit application
import TOP

# The import above automatically executes the Streamlit application
# No additional code needed as TOP.py contains all the Streamlit app logic
